## Intro

`md-slides` is a tool for presenting html-based presentations based on a Markdown documents.

Online Example (scrolling): [astromechza.github.io/md-slides/](https://astromechza.github.io/md-slides/)

Project URL: [github.com/astromechza/md-slides](https://github.com/astromechza/md-slides)

Features:

- single static binary with no runtime dependencies
- no external javascript or css
- single & multipage modes
- supports embedding images
- uses `blackfriday` markdown library
- supports custom aspect-ratios and zooms
- prints to pdf well

---

## Prior art

- _many_. Just Google "Markdown slides"
	- reveal.js
	- remark.js
	- GitPitch
	- etc..

- But I believe in building software to meet your own needs, and reinventing the wheel for yourself can be some good fun.

- And this provides a good balance between self-hosted, lock-in-free software, and feature-packed service offerings. *While still making the slide source easily readable in its source or rendered markdown forms*.

## Installation

Although you _can_ build and install it from source, we recommend that you pull
the appropriate binary for your system from the project releases page [here](https://github.com/astromechza/md-slides/releases).

Or use the installation script to be quick:

```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astromechza/md-slides/master/install.sh | INSTALL_DIRECTORY=~/bin sh
```

Eg:

```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astromechza/md-slides/master/install.sh | INSTALL_DIRECTORY=~/bin sh

## Embedded commands

`{embedcommand``: ["bash", "-c", "./md-slides --help || true"]}`

```
{embedcommand: ["bash", "-c", "./md-slides --help || true"]}
```

---

## `serve` subcommand

```
{embedcommand: ["bash", "-c", "./md-slides serve --help || true"]}
```

---

## `html` subcommand

```
{embedcommand: ["bash", "-c", "./md-slides html --help || true"]}
```

---

## Input format

A single markdown document represents the multiple slides separated by a horizantal rule:

```markdown
# this is slide one

stuff

---

# this is slide two

stuff

---

# this is slide three

stuff
```

---

## Paged vs Scrolling mode

The `-mode` flag can switch between display modes.

- `paged` is the default javascript-powered presentation mode with dynamic scaling. It attempts to scale to fit the presentation window while maintaining the slide aspect ratio and font size. It responds to key controls to advance slides.


- `scrolling` is a **no-javascript** mode with each slide below the other and with no dynamic scaling. This mode prints very well and has page hints for **PDF rendering and export**. This is also the mode used by the `--export-to` flag. It can be useful for distributing slides via email or embedding in other sites via an iframe.

---

## Extension: `{embedcommand: ...}`

Embed command embeds the combined stdout/stdin output of executing a given subcommand. The subcommand should be embeded as a json array like `["ls", "-al", "blah"]`.

For example a slide containing `{embed``command: ["date"]}` could output:

```
{embedcommand: ["date"]}
```

This makes it easy to present live content or to embed dynamic data into the slides based on the output of scripts.

---

## Extension: image dimensions in url fragment

To improve the sizing of images embedded into your slides, you can specify the width and height as url fragment parameters.

```markdown
![alt text](/my/relative/path#height=500px)

![alt text](/my/relative/path#width=500px)
```

---

## Metadata tags

A number of meta tags are available to control formatting and alignment options.

They take the form of `<meta a="blah" b="foo">`.

They apply from the current slide onwards until they are overrident or reset with an empty string.

---

## Metadata: `halign` and `valign`

These meta tags control where in the slide the content is positioned. They are most effective when used to position content to the bottom or corners of a slide.

```html
<meta valign="bottom" halign="left">
```

Allowed values for `valign` are `top`, `center`, `bottom`

Allowed values for `halign` are `left`, `center`, `right`

Good for:

- title slides
- thank you slides
- slides containing centered images, questions, blocks, etc.

---
<meta valign="bottom" halign="right">

## `Example of <meta valign="bottom" halign="right">`

second line

---
<meta valign="" halign="" talign="">

## Metadata: `talign`

The `talign` metadata should be used with `halign` and `valign` to direct the text-alignment of the slide.

```html
<meta talign="left">
```

Allowed values for `talign` are `left`, `center`, `right`

---
<meta talign="right">

## `Example of <meta talign="right">`

second line

---
<meta valign="" halign="" talign="">
<meta footer="January 1970 &vert; Some Conference">

## Metadata: `footer`

Add some footer text to the bottom left of each slide using the `footer` metadata key.

The value will persist between pages until overriden by a new value or empty string.

```html
<meta footer="January 1970 &vert; Some Conference">
```

---
<meta res="900x900">

## Metadata: `res`

This can be used to tweak the size and shape of one or more slides. This is useful for a number of things:

- adjusting aspect ratio
- extra wide slides
- zoom in or out to effectively change the font size

By default the resolution is 1600x900 but this can be changed by slides. Note that the resolution of the first slide is
used to inform the primary size and shape of the slide deck.

```html
<meta res="1600x900">
```

---
<meta res="" fontcolor="#0000ff">

## Metadata: `fontcolor`

Change the font color.

```html
<meta fontcolor="#111">
```

---
<meta res="" fontcolor="#fffff8" background="#111">

## Metadata: `background`

Change the background. Accepts colors, gradients, images, etc.

```html
<meta background="#111">
```

---
<meta valign="center" halign="center" res="" fontcolor="#fffff8" background="url(windmill.jpeg)">

# This can be used for background images too!

---
<meta valign="" halign="" talign="" fontcolor="" background="">

		result := ""
		if i%3 == 0 { result += "Fizz" }
		if i%5 == 0 { result += "Buzz" }
		if result != "" {
			fmt.Println(result)
			continue
		}
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}
```

## Tables?

<meta valign="center" halign="center">

| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
| col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |

## Distributing your slides

Two choices:

1. Use `md-slides html ..` to render to a directory and distribute as `index.html` with any images alongside it.

2. Use Chrome to Menu → Print → Save as PDF to export the output of the `serve --mode=scrolling` as a multi-page pdf.
    
    Although this is buggy and will probably not be perfect. PDF is hard!

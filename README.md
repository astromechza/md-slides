> `md-slides` is a single binary for rendering and presenting Markdown-based slides as html.

- Supports all traditional markdown features
- Support for various alignment, sizing, and resolution options
- Support for "paged" vs "scrolling" modes
- Decent support for rendering to PDF via Chrome/Chromium

See [astromechza.github.io/md-slides/](https://astromechza.github.io/md-slides/) for an example of the standalone output and a more in depth look at the features.

### Who uses md-slides?

Mostly just me!

This is a personal project and tool. You are most welcome to use it too but development is sporadic and tightly tied to my own wants and needs.
